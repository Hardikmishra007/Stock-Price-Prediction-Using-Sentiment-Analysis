# **📈 Stock Price Prediction Using Sentiment Analysis**  

This project leverages public sentiment from Reddit discussions and historical stock price data to predict stock movements for major companies like Tesla, Apple, and Amazon. Designed for ease of use in Google Colab, this project offers a seamless, end-to-end pipeline for data collection, preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and stock price prediction.  

---

## **🌟 Highlights**  

- **🚀 End-to-End Workflow**: A single Colab notebook encapsulating data collection, cleaning, analysis, and prediction.  
- **📊 Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze Reddit discussions using FinBERT, a sentiment analysis model tailored for financial data.  
- **💹 Stock Price Data**: Combine public sentiment with historical stock price trends to uncover actionable insights.  
- **🤖 Machine Learning Models**: Train and evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms to predict stock price movements effectively.

## **🛠 Workflow Overview**

### **1️⃣ Data Collection**  
- **Reddit Posts**: Use the Reddit API to scrape discussions from subreddits like `r/stocks` and `r/wallstreetbets`.  
- **Stock Data**: Fetch historical stock prices for Tesla, Apple, and Amazon using Yahoo Finance.  

### **2️⃣ Data Preprocessing**  
- **Text Cleaning**: Remove duplicates, special characters, and stopwords from Reddit posts.  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Use FinBERT to classify each post as **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative**.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Merge sentiment data with stock price data by aligning dates and companies.  

### **3️⃣ Model Training**  
- Train and evaluate the following machine learning models:  
  - **Logistic Regression**  
  - **Random Forest**  
  - **Gradient Boosting**  
  - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**  
  - **LightGBM**  

- Use **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning and evaluate models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

### **4️⃣ Final Output**  
- **Best Model**: Display the best-performing model along with its configuration and metrics.  
- **Predictions**: Predict stock price movement as Increase, Decrease, or No Change.

## **🌟 How to Use**  

### **Step 1: Download the Notebook**  
- Save the `stock_price_prediction.ipynb` file to your **local system** or **Google Drive**.  

### **Step 2: Open in Google Colab**  
- Upload the notebook to **Google Colab** or open it directly from your Google Drive.  

### **Step 3: Install Required Libraries**  
Run the following command in Colab to set up the environment:  
```python  
!pip install praw transformers torch pandas scikit-learn yfinance matplotlib lightgbm  
```  

### **Step 4: Add Reddit API Credentials**  
To scrape Reddit data, generate your own API keys:  
1. **Create a Reddit App**:  
   - Go to [Reddit's App Preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps).  
   - Create a new **Script** app and note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.  
2. **Update Credentials**:  
   - Replace placeholders in the notebook with your credentials:  
     ```python  
     reddit = praw.Reddit(
         client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",          
         client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",  
         user_agent="YOUR_USER_AGENT"         
     )
     ```  

### **Step 5: Run the Notebook**  
- Execute each cell in sequence to:  
  1. Collect data.  
  2. Preprocess text and stock data.  
  3. Perform sentiment analysis.  
  4. Train models and evaluate performance.  

### **Step 6: View Results**  
- **Model Performance**: Check the `results/results.txt` file for metrics.  
- **Processed Data**: Access datasets in the `data/` folder.
